# My Blog
Create a blog page. The theme of the blog is chosen independently, it would be nice to see live content instead of lorem ipsum, you can take content from any blog that you like.

### Header

#### The header contains three elements.

* Logotype height of at least 100px, pressed to the left edge of the container. The header must stretch in height relative to the content.

* A block of social icons and a search icon in the upper right corner of the header. The search icon should be clearly separated from the social icons.

* The navigation block in the bottom right corner of the header.

* At small resolutions, the elements should be arranged one after the other in this order: the menu hamburger, pressed to the left, at the same level the search icon, but on the right; below the logo in the center. Sotsialki to hide.

* Hamburger menu: make the adaptability of the menu, so that at small screen resolutions, for example, 780px and below, a hamburger menu appears (google search: hamburger menu css). When opened, it should appear on the left with a curtain over all content.

### Main

* Main contains a list of articles in the form of cards with brief information (photo, title, time, short description, rating, number of comments). The number of cards in one row is not fixed, depending on the available space. But the width of the cards should be relatively rubber, i.e. within some minimum / maximum size, but not rigidly fixed.

* The extreme cards on the left and right should be pressed to the left and right edges of the container, respectively. The distance between the cards must be static.

* When hovering on the card, it is necessary that the photo has an effect of zoom (zoom).

### Aside

*Aside contains the following blocks, located one after another:

* block of information about the author (photo, name, short description).

* block of social icons.

* subscribe block (name, email, full-width button).

* a full-width search block (search field and a search button with an icon pressed to it on the right).

* block tags (tags follow left-to-right and top-to-bottom, content tags in the center).

* a block of recent comments in two columns, a column on the left - a round photo of the user; the column to the right is the name, and below the comment name is one line. If the comment does not fit, then it must be truncated and end with three dots.

If there is insufficient width for main and aside, aside should be already lower than main.

### Footer

* Here you can place a logo, additional contact information, copyrights. Location is at your discretion.

### Additional requirements

* The page should be responsive. As already described, the appearance of the hamburger menu, offset aside, the responsiveness of the location of the cards in main, but also this applies to other elements of the page.

* The page needs to be revived. Add effects, animation. The main thing is not to overdo it. The color palette is at your discretion. Only, please, without poison and dirt.

### What is considered in the assessment

* Markup: structure, purity, validity.

* Styles: selectors (types, nesting), purity, organization in the file / files.

* Design of the page: alignment of elements, responsiveness of the page, the general impression.

### Where to spread

This can be github (in this case a github page!) Or any online editor, for example, codepen, jsfiddle, plunker ...
