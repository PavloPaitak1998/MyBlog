Luckily, today that isn’t much of an issue. There are tons of ways you can get started blogging today (in half an hour or less) that are <em>absolutely free</em>.</p><p>Free blogging platforms like Medium, Tumblr and Blogger are awesome resources for testing things out.</p><p>And these options are great… <em>if</em> your blog is a hobby.</p><p>However, if you’re looking to build a business out of your blog or <strong>make money blogging</strong>, I would highly recommend some of the paid (yet still <em>very</em> affordable) options that I’m going to cover below. If you’re on the fence about whether to use a free or paid hosting provider to get started… here’s why you should consider (an affordable) paid hosting provider:</p><ul><li>When you go with free, you’ll have a lack of control over how your blog looks and acts.</li></ul><ul><li>Most free services have limits on monetization.</li></ul><ul><li>Switching or upgrading to a better service eventually is a hassle.</li></ul><ul><li>There’s a lack of support if something goes wrong.</li></ul><ul><li>Free blog hosting services can disappear overnight.</li></ul><p>All of this is to say that you should think about your plan and what you want from your blog before you get started.</p><p>While it’s perfectly fine (and easy) to learn how to start a blog for free, sometimes a little investment in yourself up front can go a very long way toward paving a future that’s much more lucrative.</p><p>So in this post, I’m going to show you both routes (as well as what I’ve done to scale my blog to 2 million+ readers a year) so you can decide for yourself what makes the most sense for you, your goals and your blog.</p><h1><strong>How to Start a Blog (on the Side) in 10 Easy Steps</strong></h1><p>Let’s get one thing out of the way first: The only thing standing in the way of starting your own blog is you. It’s easy to say that you don’t have time or you’re tired from work or that it’s too much effort. But that effort is what makes starting a blog so worth it.</p><p>The bar for how to start a blog—and what constitutes great content—has been raised in 2019. And if you’re starting a blog looking for extremely quick results (i.e. earning money from a blog tomorrow), you’re going to be disappointed. You need to set realistic expectations.</p><p>This isn’t to say you can’t start a successful blog in 2019. <strong>In fact, there are more opportunities than ever</strong>. It’s just that you need to make sure you’re not falling into certain traps early on. Traps like…</p><ul><li>You think you can make a bunch of money writing about something you aren’t familiar with or passionate about</li><li>You’re not committed to publishing regularly and interacting with your audience</li><li>You want quick results without putting in the work</li></ul><p>Here’s a dose of reality: The most popular, successful and profitable blogs in 2019 are <em>all</em> run by people who care deeply about the subject matter they’re writing about. They’re committed and excited to post. And they know that running a blog is an investment that will only bring them bigger returns the more they keep at it.</p><p>And as long as you’re on the same page, your blog will be a success! Let’s dive into the first step of this starting a blog tutorial.</p><h2><a name="1" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><strong>1.&nbsp;Pick Your Blog’s Name and Domain</strong></h2><p>First, it’s time to pick a domain name for your blog, select the blogging platform and hosting you’ll be using and in order to get your blog live and readable online.</p><p>The combination of domain name &amp; hosting I personally use (and recommend to all bloggers I know) is WordPress hosted by <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>.

They don’t offer a monthly payment option (because hosting companies that do offer monthly payments charge <em>a lot</em> more). Even still, with whichever plan you choose, the price works out to be a great deal for starting your own blog and getting it online today.</p><p><strong>Which pricing plan is best?</strong></p><p>Personally, I recommend choosing the&nbsp;<strong>“Prime 36 Month Price”&nbsp;</strong>if you want to lock in the lowest possible price for your hosting. That’s what I use. And it secures your blog hosting at their lowest rate (and gets you domain privacy) for the next 3 years. And because this low pricing for new customers only applies to the first payment you make, if you were to choose the 1-year plan, your pricing <em>may</em> go up after that first year.</p><p>That’s why if you choose the 36-month plan, your pricing will be locked in at this low rate for 3 years. For that reason, I recommend going with the longest duration plan that your budget can spring for.</p><p><strong>Choosing the right package extras (skip all but one).</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="lazy-hidden  wp-image-6410 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-1024x467.jpg" alt="How to Start a Blog Extras" width="752" height="343" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-300x137.jpg 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-768x350.jpg 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras.jpg 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px"><noscript><img class=" wp-image-6410 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-1024x467.jpg" alt="How to Start a Blog Extras" width="752" height="343" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-300x137.jpg 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras-768x350.jpg 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Extras.jpg 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" /></noscript></a></p><p>I highly recommend keeping the Domain Privacy Protection extra, but you can get away with skipping the rest. Later on in this guide to start a blog, I’ll show you the many free and cheap plugins &amp; tools you can use for things like SEO optimization, rendering most of these package extras not necessary.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier though, having the domain privacy extra keeps all of your personal contact information (your name, email, phone number and address) private. Now, if you chose the <strong>Choice Plus Plan</strong> on the previous screen, then your Domain Privacy Protection will be listed as “Free” just like this screenshot above shows—it’s included in that plan.</p><p>If you chose a Basic or Plus Plan, then you’ll want to check the box to add Domain Privacy Protection to your order for around $1/mo.</p><p>The total you’ll now see is the amount you’re going to pay today.

When you get started with a hosting company like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>, <strong>they’ll let you choose the domain name later</strong>. As I said above, if you don’t immediately see the domain name you want available, don’t get hung up—just select their option to choose it later after getting everything else set up (remember, execution is what you’re here for, not perfection).</p><p>But because this is one of the most frequently asked questions I get from readers who are learning how to start a blog, let’s dig into this for a moment…</p><p>Now, while the name you choose is one of the more important parts of setting up your blog, remember that it’s something you can always change in the future—so don’t let this step hold you back. Just choose something that’s&nbsp;<em>close</em> to the topics you’re planning to blog about, or you can even grab <em>yourname.com</em> or&nbsp;<em>yournickname.com</em> (like I’ve done with my blog here, ryrob.com) and let’s keep moving.</p><p>Your blog name is the first thing people see when you show up in search results and can often tell them about who you are, what you’re writing about, and even your personality.</p><p>Like I said, there are tons of ways to come up with a name for your blog (you can even use your own name—or a nickname like me 😊). So let’s run through a few fun exercises to help you pick a name while you’re learning how to start a blog.</p><p><strong>First, dig deep into your niche.</strong></p><p><img class="lazy-hidden wp-image-3889 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche.jpg" alt="How to Start a Blog Hiking Niche" width="747" height="496" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche.jpg 960w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche-300x199.jpg 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px"><noscript><img class="wp-image-3889 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche.jpg" alt="How to Start a Blog Hiking Niche" width="747" height="496" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche.jpg 960w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche-300x199.jpg 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Hiking-Niche-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></noscript></p><p>The first thing you want to do, is get familiar with other people in your industry (if you’re not already).</p><p>For example, if you want to start a blog about hiking and you live in the state of California… one name you might consider for your blog could be letshikecalifornia.com (what I chose for my <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/validate-business-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">30 day business idea validation challenge</a>).</p><p>Check out the other blogs in your niche and pay special attention to how they name and brand themselves.</p><p>Is there anything you can learn from, play off of, or subvert?

I like to call this looking for “good words.” What words keep popping up that you’re drawn to? Make a list of these.</p><p><strong>Next, uncover your why.</strong></p><p>You’re learning how to start a blog for a reason, and a powerful name speaks to that reason. Go back to your list from picking a niche and start to dig into what represents the core message you’re trying to say. As Nate Weiner, founder of Pocket said:</p><p><em>“The first question to ask yourself is why do you want to rebrand? What does your company and product mean? Where do you want to take it into the future? Does your existing or new name let you do that?”</em></p><p>This might feel like a big question, but don’t let it paralyze you. A great name has meaning, but there are plenty of good ones that are just plain fun and memorable.</p><p><strong>Now, put yourself in your reader’s shoes.</strong></p><p>You’ve laid some good groundwork, but now it’s time to get serious. Think about your future blog’s general topic area and who your ideal reader is. What do they want to read? What’s going to grab their attention? What’s going to tell them they <em>have</em> to read your blog?</p><p>Start with a list of everything you want your blog to be about. Go deep. There are no bad ideas here.</p><p>Once you’ve got a massive list, start to look for connections and combinations that might work. Try to keep them simple and memorable.</p><p>Some great blog name examples are:</p><ul><li>Art of Manliness</li><li>Smart Passive Income</li><li>Epicurious</li><li>The Huffington Post</li><li>Learn to Code with Me</li></ul><p><strong>Finally, say it out loud and tell it to people.</strong></p><p>It’s easy to get wrapped up in some fun wordplay when it comes to picking a blog name.</p><p>But it still needs to be easy enough that people will remember it and be able to tell their friends about you. To practice, say the name out loud and to friends and family. What do they think about it? What emotions does it bring up for them?</p><p>They might not be your ideal reader, but they can still give you a good outsider’s perspective either way.</p><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="background-color: #fdf2d0;">If You Haven't Registered Your Domain Yet, it's Time.</span></strong></h3><p style="text-align: center;">Take&nbsp;30 seconds right now to get&nbsp;<strong>65% off</strong> registering your domain name and hosting with <strong><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>,</strong> the most affordable and reliable blog hosting provider I've used with several websites over the years.</p><div style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" id="btn_1_9a15844da3943fea4ac8bf7c7de02967" class="css-button style-1" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="nofollow"><span class="text">Get Domain and Hosting Now</span><span class="hover"></span><span class="active"></span></a></div><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><p><strong>Ready to register your domain name and set up hosting? </strong></p><p>I made this quick video tutorial to walk you step-by-step through the entire process in just a few minutes:</p><div class="embed-container"><iframe class="lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTmjV-Ykiu0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><noscript><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTmjV-Ykiu0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></noscript></div><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><p>I know first-hand that learning how to start a blog can be a massive undertaking.</p><p>And if you need a little more detailed guidance, I put together <strong>a free master course</strong> for you to take that spreads all of this work out into a series of action-packed lessons and goes into even more granular detail than this tutorial.</p><p>While the first crucial step to getting your blog started <em>today</em> is registering your domain name and setting up hosting (<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>get 65% off your domain and hosting right here from Bluehost</strong></a>), my free course breaks the entire process of starting a blog and actually growing it, down into an incredibly simple 7-day process for going from zero to publishing (and promoting) your first blog post in less than 1 week.

If you’ve gone the free route, you can skip this step, although I highly recommend reading through it and making a decision at the end.</p><p>Again, I don’t want this to feel overwhelming, so let’s get the basics out of the way:</p><h3><strong>What is website hosting?</strong></h3><p>I touched on this a bit above, but to make your website accessible to other people on the Internet, you need a “host.” The host keeps all your website files safe, secure and makes sure that people can access your site when they click on a link or type in your URL.</p><p>I use and recommend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>&nbsp;to every blogger, because it acts as a one-stop shop for great (affordable) hosting and quick &amp; easy registration of your domain name in one swoop.</p><p>So, if you've already completed the first step above and gotten setup with Bluehost—then you can skip this step! You've already got your domain name and hosting squared away.</p><p>Think of hosting like being your home. When someone comes over (types in your URL), they’ll be able to see all the things you’ve been keeping inside. Yes, it comes at&nbsp;a cost you don't have if you're on one of the free blogging platforms, but having a proper website host is one of the most important investments in starting a successful blog.</p><p>When my friend, Michelle Schroeder started her personal finance blog, Making Sense of Cents, she started by using a free blogging platform called Blogger to host her site. This choice ended up costing her more than she’d saved:</p><p><em>“My biggest mistake was probably starting on Blogger, because you don’t own it. At one point Google deleted my blog with no notice. I finally begged them and they gave it back to me, but that was the moment I decided to move over to self-hosted WordPress.”</em></p><p><strong>Michelle’s gone on to grow her blog revenue well into the millions of dollars a year</strong>—something she says never would have happened if she hadn’t switched over to a paid hosting provider.</p><p>In fact, her number one piece of advice for new bloggers is to start on a self-hosted WordPress site and <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">use Bluehost</a> as your host.</p><h3><strong>What are the best blog hosting services?</strong></h3><p>There are tons of great website hosting services out there for your blog.</p><p>But what you should be looking for in all of them is:</p><ul><li>Speed</li><li>Features</li><li>Security</li><li>Support</li><li>Track record</li></ul><p>The one service I’ve found that checks all of these boxes (and more) for just getting started is <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>. Yes, I know I’ve mentioned them several times already in this guide, and that’s for very good reason.</p><p>For one, Bluehost offers an incredibly simple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">1-click WordPress install</a>, which makes starting a self-hosted WordPress blog super easy. It also comes with a free domain name (if your desired URL is available) and offers 24/7 support to answer all of your questions and help with troubleshooting (which is fantastic when you’re just getting started).</p><p><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="lazy-hidden  wp-image-5415 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob.png" alt="How to Start a Blog and Make Money Online (on the Side) Bluehost Hosting Offer for ryrob" width="750" height="395" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob.png 2798w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob-300x158.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob-768x405.png 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob-1024x539.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><noscript><img class=" wp-image-5415 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob.png" alt="How to Start a Blog and Make Money Online (on the Side) Bluehost Hosting Offer for ryrob" width="750" height="395" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob.png 2798w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob-300x158.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob-768x405.png 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-to-Start-a-Blog-and-Make-Money-Online-on-the-Side-Bluehost-Hosting-Offer-for-ryrob-1024x539.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></noscript></a></p><p>If you’re going the paid route in learning how to start a blog (the way I recommend you doing it), nothing gives you the security, features, and peace of mind that your blog will be up when you need it to be like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a> does.</p><p>Now we're at the point in this guide where everything from here on out will be built upon the assumption that you've already registered your domain name and chosen the right hosting plan—so if you haven't done so already, take just a few minutes to quickly get set up on Bluehost.</p><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="background-color: #fdf2d0;">Quickly Grab Your Domain Name and Hosting Today</span></strong></h3><p style="text-align: center;">Take&nbsp;30 seconds right now to get&nbsp;<strong>65% off</strong> registering your domain name and hosting with <strong><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>,</strong> the most affordable and reliable blog hosting provider I've used with several websites over the years.</p><div style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" id="btn_1_9a15844da3943fea4ac8bf7c7de02967" class="css-button style-1" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="nofollow"><span class="text">Get Domain and Hosting Now</span><span class="hover"></span><span class="active"></span></a></div><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><h2><a name="3" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><strong>3.

That’s the first post on my blog. And while it’s a far cry from the highly tactical, in-depth and entrepreneurial-focused content I publish today, I wanted to share a message from it that I still regularly refer back to:</p><p><em>“It’s so easy to continue down the path you’re on in life, allowing the feeling of comfort to rule your daily actions… but if you never take calculated risks, you’ll find yourself regretting that you never tried.</em>”</p><p><strong>Starting a blog</strong> was a calculated risk for me. But it's one that's changed my life for the better both personally and professionally. And I believe that if you put the work in, starting a blog can do the same for you.</p><p>If you’re completely new to learning how to start a blog, some of this might seem a bit daunting.</p><p>So let’s get the basic terminology out of the way first.</p><h3><strong>What is a CMS?</strong></h3><p>A Content Management System (or CMS) is where you'll be writing, designing, and publishing your blog posts. A good CMS is easy to use, let’s you organize your content, upload images and videos, and have control over how your entire blog looks using themes or custom design elements.</p><p>The most popular CMS you’ve most likely heard of is WordPress, which is what I use here on my blog. In fact, the latest numbers say that <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/?kaid=ZSBZJKNNNPLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">over 60% of all blogs run on this CMS</a>, including the websites for Forbes, New York Observer, TED, Thought Catalog, TechCrunch, NBC and others.</p><h3><strong>Should I start my blog on WordPress? And is WordPress free?</strong></h3><p>Of course, there are other CMS options you can look at, such as Squarespace, Ghost, and Wix when learning how to start a blog. However, <strong>I strongly recommend setting up a self-hosted WordPress site for your blog</strong> as it’s the most sustainable, long-term solution—and really the only option worth considering if you're starting a blog with the eventual goal of making money from your website in some way, shape or form.</p><p>Since I learned how to start a blog, I’ve been running my blog on WordPress (hosted with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>&nbsp;for the first few years) and I couldn’t be happier with the amount of flexibility, control and long-term growth potential I have over my site.</p><p>Now, one thing you need to be careful of is that WordPress comes in two very different platforms. <em>WordPress.com</em> and <em>WordPress.org</em>. They have almost the same name, but there are very big differences between the two:</p><p><img class="lazy-hidden wp-image-3885 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob.png" alt="How to Start a Blog WordPress dot com vs WordPress dot org ryrob" width="750" height="539" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob.png 960w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob-300x215.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><noscript><img class="wp-image-3885 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob.png" alt="How to Start a Blog WordPress dot com vs WordPress dot org ryrob" width="750" height="539" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob.png 960w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob-300x215.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Wordpress-dot-com-vs-Wordpress-dot-org-ryrob-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></noscript></p><p><strong>WordPress.com:</strong></p><ul><li>Is free to use</li><li>Doesn’t let you pick a custom domain name (i.e. 👉 yoursite.wordpress.com)</li><li>Has very limited monetization options (you can’t sell your own ads)</li><li>Doesn’t let you upload plugins (for email capture and other things)</li><li>Has limited theme support so you’re stuck with very basic designs</li><li>You have to pay to remove WordPress branding</li><li>Limited SEO and analytics</li></ul><p><strong>WordPress.org:</strong></p><ul><li>Fully customizable design, unlimited plugin options, and no branding</li><li>Total control over your own monetization efforts</li><li>Powerful SEO features (so people can find your site easier)</li><li>Let’s you start or add an eCommerce store or membership site</li><li>Small monthly fee (approx. $46 – $100/year +hosting)</li></ul><p>While the choice is yours, if you want to take full advantage of your blog, be able to have it grow with you, and eventually make money from it, <strong>WordPress.org is the way to go when learning how to start a blog</strong>.

And why does your blog need one?</strong></h3><p>A niche is more than just a topic. It’s the approach you’re going to take, the audience you want to go after, and the way you’re going to talk to them and position yourself as an expert.</p><p>A niche doesn’t <em>have</em> to be your passion (although it’s definitely easier to stay committed to starting your blog when you’re passionate about it). But it does have to be an interest of yours. The best niches are exciting enough that you’ll be motivated to continually post about it, and accessible enough that you can build an audience.</p><p>So, whether that means Medieval history, traditional Mexican cooking, starting a drop-shipping business, or knitting tips, is up to you.</p><p><strong>The reason your blog needs a niche is that it gives it focus.</strong> Your niche is how you’ll plan your content calendar, decide on design, and know where (and how) to market your blog. It’s also how your audience will find you and how you’ll make connections with other bloggers.</p><p>Remember, when you write to everyone. You’re writing to no one.</p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22When+you+write+to+everyone%2C+you%27re+writing+to+no+one.+If+you+start+a+blog%2C+it+needs+a+niche.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"When you write to everyone, you're writing to no one.

We can coax it out of you with a few questions.</p><p>Let’s begin with some basics:</p><ul><li>What's an interest or dream from your childhood that you find exciting?</li><li>What’s the absolute best part of your day?</li><li>Do you have any hobbies or hobbies that you want to learn?</li><li>What is a deeply held value of yours?</li><li>What’s one achievement that you’re incredibly proud of?</li></ul><p>Right away, you should have an idea or two for what you could learn how to start a blog around. But let’s go a bit deeper before we decide on a niche.</p><p>Next, <strong>list out 5 things you find easy to do.</strong> We tend to be interested in things we’re naturally good at. Which means you’ll be able to write about them from a place of authority and confidence. Don’t overthink it too much. But be as specific as possible.</p><p>For example, instead of saying “photography,” say “taking photos of beautiful landscapes, especially at National parks.”</p><p>Now, <strong>write down a list of 5 things you spend your free time on</strong>. Try to stick to things that are both what you “want” to do and that you "have" to do in order to hit some goal.</p><p>Finally, look through your answers and pick out the patterns, phrases and common keywords. Is there anything that jumps out right away? Are there any themes you can see like wanting to spend time outdoors or cooking?</p><p>Pick these out and rank them in true importance on a scale of 1–10.

So, if we wanted to learn how to start a blog about playing guitar you might choose keywords like “best guitar books”, “how to play guitar”, “beginner guitar chords”, “what guitar should I buy” and so on.</p><p>Now, enter one of those keywords into your Google search. If there are tens of millions (or more) results, that’s a pretty strong indicator that people care about your topic. But to be extra sure, I like to use a free tool like <a href="http://kwfinder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">KW Finder</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/semrush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">SEMrush</a> to check the Monthly Search Volume (how many people are searching for this term each month).</p><p>Do this for each of your keywords and look at the results. If all of your top keywords have a Monthly Search Volume of 5,000 – 10,000, you’ve definitely got a potentially profitable niche. If you’re too much over that up into the high hundreds of thousands of Monthly Searches, you might want to get more specific with your niche rather than competing with much larger, established websites on more popular subjects.</p><p>Over time, as you move from this beginning phase of learning how to start a blog and into the stages where you're progressing in different <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/drive-traffic-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ways to drive traffic to your website</a>, growing your established base of readers and focusing on improving your&nbsp;<a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">domain authority</a>, you'll be able to start competing on the bigger topics—but for now, picking a niche is the name of the game.</p><h3><strong>Who is your ideal reader?</strong></h3><p>Another great exercise if you’re trying to decide on a niche for your blog is to think about who your ideal reader is. This is the person most likely to visit your blog and get value from your writing. For me, the easiest way to think about this is to use myself as an example. If you’re writing about an interest, then you’re most likely your ideal reader.</p><p>But that isn’t always the case. And what you might find as you learn how to start blogging, is that the audience you thought you were attracting is actually different from who’s reading you.</p><p>Take Millo.co for example again. When Preston first started the blog, he was publishing 3–5X a week on a variety of topics like design, freelancing, and starting a small business. But then he started to see that his audience was being attracted to a certain type of post:</p><p>“<em>The turning point for me came when I realized that of the 3-5x a week I was publishing it was the ones that were about small businesses and freelancing that really took off. I also really enjoyed writing that kind of content. So that was this pivotal moment of understanding if I want things to be shared and I want to be consistent, this is what the blog should be about.”</em></p><p>Don’t worry about this too much as you’re beginning your journey of learning how to start a blog. But do think about how much you can write for the niche you’re picking. Can you come up with 10 blog post ideas for this niche that you would be interested in? How about 100?</p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22Want+to+start+a+successful+blog%3F+Consistency+and+genuine+interest+are+going+to+be+key.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"Want to start a successful blog?

You can think of a theme as the template for the visual layout of your blog. If you’re not a web developer (and I’m definitely not one), having a good theme makes design and organization of your site a snap.</p><p>If you’ve gone with a self-hosted WordPress site like I suggested, you’ll have literally thousands of amazing free and paid theme options at your disposal. Plus, once you buy a theme (which are relatively inexpensive investments) like the one I use for my blog here, <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/optimizepress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">OptimizePress</a>, you'll own it forever and get all the benefits of excellent support and customization options that come with premium WordPress themes.</p><p>However, if you’re using a free blogging platform, you’re most likely going to be quite limited in the themes and design options you have.</p><p>Let’s assume at this point we’re working with a self-hosted WordPress blog (like mine). Here’s what you should be looking for in a theme and your site’s design.</p><h3><strong>Why design is so important when learning how to start a blog</strong></h3><p>Even if you don’t really care about design, your readers do.</p><p>In <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/38315.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">a 2012 study</a> from Google and the University of Basel, researchers found that users judge a website’s aesthetic beauty and perceived functionality in 1/20th – 1/50th of a second. Plus, thanks to a little psychological bias called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">the Halo Effect</a>, we extend that judgement to all parts of your blog.</p><p>What this means is that in less time than it takes to snap their fingers, a reader has decided whether or not to trust your blog.</p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22In+less+time+than+it+takes+to+snap+your+fingers%2C+readers+decide+whether+or+not+to+trust+your+blog.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"In less time than it takes to snap your fingers, readers decide whether or not to trust your blog."</a></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22In+less+time+than+it+takes+to+snap+your+fingers%2C+readers+decide+whether+or+not+to+trust+your+blog.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" class="tm-ctt-btn" data-wpel-link="internal">Click To Tweet</a></p><div class="tm-ctt-tip"></div></div><p><strong>Good design builds trust.</strong> It tells people that you care enough about your blog to make it look nice. This doesn’t mean you need crazy animations or tons of fonts and colors. In fact, the best designs are simple, clear, and easy to read.</p><p>A nice theme and design for your blog is one of the best (relatively inexpensive) investments you can make early on as you’re trying to attract more readers.</p><p>As Michelle Schroeder of <em>Making Sense of Cents</em>&nbsp;shared with me during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/making-sense-of-cents-michelle-schroeder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">our interview</a>:</p><p><em>“One of the best investments I ever made was getting a designer to create a more professional design for my blog. It was a big investment because at the time I wasn’t making a lot of money from it. But everything has just grown from there.” </em></p><p>However, I know it can be difficult to just “know” what kind of design you want for your blog—especially as you're just learning how to start a blog in the first place.</p><p>I suggest gathering inspiration by starting with looking at the blogs you admire the most. What is it about the way they look that you enjoy? Look at their logo and branding. The way they layout text. How you navigate and search for topics. What makes this site look good and feel good to use?</p><p>Write all this down in a blog inspiration document. It’s important to have this foundation before looking at themes and talking about design. These values will guide you through the sea of blog themes we’re about to dive headfirst into!</p><h3><strong>How to pick the right theme for your blog</strong></h3><p>Picking a blog theme can be a lot of fun. But it can also take up a ton of time that you could otherwise be using to write and promote your posts (and thus getting to your first blog income faster).</p><p>There are so many themes to check out, that it’s easy to get swept away by the ones that look awesome, but might not be functionally great.</p><p>Remember, design isn’t just about how your blog looks. It’s about how it works. And the easier it is to navigate and read, the better.</p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22Design+isn%27t+just+about+how+your+blog+looks%2C+it%27s+about+how+it+works.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"Design isn't just about how your blog looks, it's about how it works."</a></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22Design+isn%27t+just+about+how+your+blog+looks%2C+it%27s+about+how+it+works.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" class="tm-ctt-btn" data-wpel-link="internal">Click To Tweet</a></p><div class="tm-ctt-tip"></div></div><p>Here are a few suggestions of what to look for when checking out themes:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong>&nbsp;At the end of the day, the goal of starting a blog is to share content that can be easily consumed (read, watched, experienced). And unfortunately, a lot of fancy blog themes get in the way of that. Don’t get too drawn in by crazy looking themes that compromise on legibility and usability. If a theme looks good, but doesn’t help you share your thoughts and engage with readers, it’s not a good theme.</li><li><strong>Responsiveness is a must:</strong> Responsiveness refers to themes that make sure your blog looks as good on a laptop, as it does on someone’s smartphone. Today, more and more people use their phones to read blogs and depending on your audience, that number could be 50% or higher (like mine is). Google also favors mobile-friendly websites and ranks them at the top of their organic search results. If you’re not totally sure whether a theme is mobile friendly or not, copy and paste the URL of the theme’s demo page into Google’s <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mobile Friendly Test</a> page. (This test will almost always show <em>some</em> warnings. But major red flags to watch out for are text too small or content wider than screen.)</li><li><strong>Does it work in different browsers?</strong> Your readers won’t just be using different devices, but different browsers. Most theme developers rigorously test their themes across browsers, but sometimes mistakes slip through. Try testing on a couple different browsers just to make sure.</li><li><strong>Supported plugins:</strong> If you’re using WordPress, the real power of your blog comes from plugins. These are “Add-ons” to your blog that give you extra functionality. Make sure the theme you’re choosing supports all popular plugins. If you’re unsure, ask the developer.</li><li><strong>SEO friendliness:</strong> SEO, or search engine optimization, refers to how well Google and other search engines can find your information when people search for it. Some themes use bulky code that makes it difficult for search engines to read. And while no one expects you to inspect a theme’s code you should see if the developer has said it is optimized for SEO.</li><li><strong>Support:</strong> Problems happen. And when they do, you want to be able to ask for help. Lots of free theme developers won’t offer support for their products. So that’s one thing to be aware of when making your choice.</li><li><strong>Ratings and reviews:</strong> Look for themes with a good track record. If the theme is sold on a third-party marketplace you should be able to see reviews no problem. For free WordPress theme, you’ll see the ratings just below the download button.</li></ul><h3><strong>My favorite blog theme</strong></h3><p>If you’re looking to set up landing pages, a blog, and a membership site, my favorite blog theme (and the one that I’ve been using for years here) is <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/optimizepress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">OptimizePress</a>.

Yoast helps you to optimize your blog post titles, descriptions, content length and other elements across your entire blog so that you can be found easier by search engines.</p><p><strong>2. <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/optinmonster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">OptinMonster</a>.</strong>&nbsp;If you’re building an email list of readers, OptinMonster has a suite of tools to help you convert more readers into email subscribers, especially with their exit-intent popups that catch visitors with a custom offer as they’re about to leave your site.</p><p><strong>3. <a href="https://wpforms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">WPForms</a>.</strong>&nbsp;You’ll want your readers to be able to get in touch with you easily. WPForms lets you drag &amp; drop contact forms onto pages so you can do this easily.</p><p><strong>4. <a href="https://sumo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Sumo</a>.</strong>&nbsp;Social shares, email captures, and more.

Connect MonsterInsights to your Google Analytics account (you can <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">sign up for a free Google Analytics account right here</a>) to find out who’s coming to your site, how long they’re sticking around, and what your most popular blog posts are.</p><p><strong>6. <a href="https://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">BackupBuddy</a>.</strong>&nbsp;Again, sometimes things go wrong.

However, doing it in the code of your theme can cause issues. This plugin lets you add small snippets of code easily.</p><h3><strong>The best places to find a designer for your blog.</strong></h3><p>Before we move on, I want to give you one last option for creating the blog design you’re after: hiring a designer.</p><p>Yes, it’s an additional cost. But we’re not all design-minded. And I’m a big believer that we should always play to our strengths and outsource our weaknesses. So, if design isn’t one of your strong points and you have the budget to accommodate, it might be a good idea to hire someone to help you out.</p><p>Luckily, there are tons of amazing resources for hiring freelance blog designers out there. If you want to go this route, here are a few I suggest:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Upwork</a>.</strong> One of the largest and most well-established marketplaces for freelance talent. You can easily find a web designer or graphic designer looking for <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/work-from-home-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">work from home jobs</a> that can help with your blog on Upwork. Simply post your job and they’ll send you a shortlist of people to work with.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Fiverr</a>.</strong> Browse thousands of profiles of blog designers offering their services for as little as $5. You’ll pay significantly more for quality and more complex work, but it’s a great place to see profiles and check out styles.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://99designs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">99Designs</a>.</strong> Unlike the other marketplaces, 99Designs runs on a contest system. Which means you write what you’re after and multiple designers will send you ideas to “compete” for your business. This is a great option if you’re not totally sure what style you want and are looking to get some ideas from multiple people.</li></ul><p>If you do decide to hire a designer, it’s always a good idea to do your homework beforehand and know exactly what you’re after. There’s nothing more time-consuming (and expensive) than going back and forth with a freelancer because you didn’t have a clear vision of what you wanted in the first place. If you're looking for more sites to track down some freelance designers, check out my list of the <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/freelance-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">best freelance job sites</a>.</p><p>If you find yourself getting lost, go back to your original blog inspiration doc and remind yourself of what’s most important when it comes to your design.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Want my Free Course: How to Start a Profitable Blog in 7 Days?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: center;">Enter your name and email address and you'll get instant&nbsp;access to my course that's been featured on <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Business Insider</em> and <em>Entrepreneur</em>.</p><div id="5ca649bc29916" class="optin-box optin-box-6" style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;"><div class="optin-box-content"><form action="https://www.ryrob.com/process-optin-form/" method="post" class="cf op-optin-validation"><div style="display:none"><input type="hidden" name="provider" value="convertkit"><input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="https://www.ryrob.com/check-your-email-course/"><input type="hidden" name="list" value="400978"></div><div class="text-boxes"><div class="text-box name"><input type="text" required="required" name="name" placeholder="Enter your first name" value=""></div><div class="text-box email"><input type="email" required="required" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" value=""></div></div><div style="text-align:center"><button type="submit" id="btn_1_57921bcf97731e16ffbaaef5cb376078" class="css-button style-1 location_optin_box_style_7"><span class="text">Join Now</span><span class="hover"></span><span class="active"></span></button></div> <input type="hidden" name="op_gdpr_consent_notes_field" value="missing_integration_type"> <input type="hidden" name="op_gdpr_button_label" value="Join Now"> <input type="hidden" value="493200" name="op_gdpr_consent_tag[]"> <input type="hidden" id="op_optin_nonce" name="op_optin_nonce" value="90a223cfb0"><input type="hidden" name="_wp_http_referer" value="/how-start-blog/"></form><p class="privacy"><img class="lazy-hidden" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/optin_box/privacy.png" alt="privacy" width="16" height="15"><noscript><img src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/optin_box/privacy.png" alt="privacy" width="16" height="15" /></noscript> Trust me, I hate spam just as much as you do.</p></div></div><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><h2><strong><a name="6" data-wpel-link="internal"></a>6.

Or, you can tell them a story and turn them into a fan. I’d also opt for the second path, and that’s what we’re going to explain how to do here.</p><p>Writing about yourself isn’t easy. So let’s start with a few basic questions that every great blog About page should answer:</p><p><strong>1. What value are you creating for your readers?</strong></p><p>It might be called an About page, but you don’t want to make the mistake of only talking about yourself. Yes, you’ll get to talk about who you are, but your About page should be just as much about your readers and the value you’re creating for them.</p><p>First things first, you need to be ultra clear on who your audience is and the value you create for them. For example, my blog is all about helping people find the <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/best-businesses-start-while-working-full-time-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">best business ideas</a> and to launch profitable side projects. So, that’s exactly what I say at the top of my About page.</p><p>This helps readers get grounded and know that they’re in the right place.</p><p><strong>2. Who is your blog for? </strong></p><p>Your value statement will touch on who your ideal reader is, but you want to make sure when the right person gets to your blog they know they’re in the right place. This is like a secret handshake for your blog. Nail it, and you’ll make every single person feel like they’re where they belong.</p><p>So how do you do this? There’s a couple approaches you can take:</p><ul><li>Tell them who the blog is for: There’s nothing more basic than just saying what you are. So, for example, if you’re making a community for cooking tips for working moms, just write: <em>“Started in X as a cooking resource for working moms.”</em></li></ul><ul><li>Show proof that you’re part of their community: You can show your readers that you’re part of their community in a number of ways. Do you write for other blogs or sites that are in your niche or actively contribute to popular communities and forums? What about adding a testimonial or social post from someone in the industry who read and liked your blog.</li></ul><p>Personally, if you have the resources I would go for the second option. Not only does this tell readers who you are and if they’re in the right place. But it also gives you a chance to show social proof (that other people have recognized you as a thought leader). Of course, you might not have this right away, so it’s perfectly fine to just go with the first option.</p><p><img class="lazy-hidden wp-image-3906 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility.png" alt="How to Start a Blog About Page Credibility" width="746" height="262" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility.png 961w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility-300x106.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility-768x270.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px"><noscript><img class="wp-image-3906 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility.png" alt="How to Start a Blog About Page Credibility" width="746" height="262" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility.png 961w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility-300x106.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-About-Page-Credibility-768x270.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></noscript></p><p>Now, what if someone reads your About page and says “Well, this isn’t for me?” That’s perfectly fine. The more you know your ideal reader, the better your blog will serve that person. Just like when you were picking your blog niche, if you try to write for everyone, you’ll end up writing for no one.</p><p><strong>3. Why should they listen to you?</strong></p><p>If you’ve done a good job in the first few sections, your reader should have a pretty good idea of who you are and be able to decide whether or not they want to keep reading you. However, at this point, it doesn’t hurt to talk a bit more about yourself and sell them on why you’re the blog they should follow.</p><p>That means answering a few more questions and setting their expectations.

Or, if you’d rather not have your personal email out there for anyone to find, you can include a contact form.</p><p>If you’re on WordPress, one of the best ways to do this is to use a plugin like <a href="https://wpforms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">WPForms</a>, which lets you create custom contact forms just by dragging and dropping elements.</p><p>When you’re making your blog Contact page, it’s not enough to just put up the form, however. You need to think about why someone would want to get in touch with you. Can you answer basic questions upfront with an FAQ on your contact page? If you’re selling your services, can you tell people basic requirements so you don’t waste each other’s time?</p><p>For my blog, I know that people reading it might want to hire me to help them with their own content marketing. Which is why I’ve chosen to make my Contact page more focused around the topic of how to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">“Work with Me”</a>&nbsp;on my blog. This page says exactly what I do, who I’m looking to work with, and gives opportunities for people to get in touch.</p><p>What’s so great about this is that I get mostly business-related messages because of this. For everything blog and content-related, I try to get people to stick to comments and social media. This way, comments are public and other readers can learn from them and engage.</p><p>Think about what types of communication you want your readers to use and for what.

I've been lucky enough to work for some fantastic companies and (get paid to) learn about the importance of having a <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">content strategy</a> for your blog. And I've successfully applied those same lessons to my own blog as well.</p><h3><strong>First off, why have a content strategy?</strong></h3><p>Creating a “content strategy” might sound like a complex, time-consuming, buzzword-laden process requiring an MBA and a keg filled with coffee. But it’s really not.</p><p>A strategy is really just an actionable plan for all the things you’ve already figured out.</p><p>If you know your niche and understand your why...</p><p>If you know your ideal reader and what they’re looking for...</p><p>If you know the value you want to give them and your unique angle...</p><p>Then creating a content strategy is as easy as solving your readers most pressing challenges.</p><p>Better yet, having a content strategy will help you when you’re feeling unmotivated (more than just a <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/motivational-quotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">motivational quote</a> poster can ever accomplish), when you don’t know what to write about, or when you're thinking about giving up on your blog.</p><p>Here’s how to put a basic blog content strategy together:</p><p><strong>1. Define your goal for your blog.</strong></p><p>What do you want to achieve with your blog content? Is it to drive traffic and get readers? To get people to sign up for your email newsletter? To get them to download a book you wrote or some other resource?</p><p>This goal might change as you start to build your blog, but it’s still important to know it early on. As prolific blogger and marketing guru Seth Godin explains:</p><p><em>“You have the freedom to make these choices at the beginning when they’re free, fast, and easy. Not later on when you’ve made commitments.” </em></p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22You+have+the+freedom+to+make+choices+in+the+beginning%2C+not+later+on+once+you%27ve+committed.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"You have the freedom to make choices in the beginning, not later on once you've committed."</a></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22You+have+the+freedom+to+make+choices+in+the+beginning%2C+not+later+on+once+you%27ve+committed.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" class="tm-ctt-btn" data-wpel-link="internal">Click To Tweet</a></p><div class="tm-ctt-tip"></div></div><p>Once you understand your bigger goal (i.e. why you chose to learn how to start a blog in the first place) we can start to define the mini-wins that will help you get there.</p><p><strong>2. Really get to know your readers (and where they hang out).</strong></p><p>Your readers determine whether or not your blog is successful. And to write for them, you need to really understand them—which is why it helps if you're also writing for yourself. This guarantees at least an audience of one.</p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22Who+you+write+for+is+equally+as+important+as+what+you+write.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"Who you write for is equally as important as what you write."</a></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22Who+you+write+for+is+equally+as+important+as+what+you+write.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" class="tm-ctt-btn" data-wpel-link="internal">Click To Tweet</a></p><div class="tm-ctt-tip"></div></div><p>I'm a firm believer that you write your blog posts for, is equally as important as what you write about.</p><p>In a lot of cases, you’re going to be your ideal reader, which makes this whole process easier. But in almost every case, it’s useful to do a bit of research around the audience you’re writing for (heck, you might even learn something about yourself!)</p><p>To start, you want to think about the demographics and psychographics of your ideal audience:</p><ul><li><strong>Demographics:</strong> The quantitative traits of your readers. Think, age, gender, location, job title, etc…</li><li><strong>Psychographics:</strong> The more “unmeasurable” traits like values, interests, attitude, and belief systems.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve written down these qualities, you can start to come up with <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">an audience persona</a>—a fictionalized version of your ideal reader. So, you might say that you’re starting a cooking blog for Chad, a 30–40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Portland, Oregon who values organic ingredients and isn’t too worried about food costs.</p><p>Now, the next question is: Where does Chad hang out online?</p><ul><li>Is he searching for recipes on Google or Pinterest?</li><li>Is he a heavy Facebook user or does he prefer niche community sites and forums?</li><li>Does he comment on other cooking sites or is he consuming content just to read?</li></ul><p>The goal of your blog is to create value for <em>your</em> Chad.</p><p>BUT... you can’t do that until you know who your ideal reader is and where they spend their time. If you’re not totally sure, it’s fine if you have more than one ideal reader. It’s important to make sure that your personas aren’t too broad (as your readers might not know that you’re writing for them right away).</p><p><strong>3. Decide on your content pillars.</strong></p><p>When it comes to actually deciding what you’re going to write about, it’s good to have a few guiding topics that you refer back to. I like to call these content pillars as they’re the foundation that holds up the rest of your blog.</p><p>Having a few set pillars like this helps keep your blog focused. It also gives you a lense and a voice that you can write from. For example, if you’re starting a personal finance blog, your pillars might be:</p><ul><li>Personal finance tips and tricks</li><li>Interviews and stories from people who’ve found financial independence</li><li>Your take on important financial industry news</li><li>The basics of personal finance</li><li>How to pay off your debt quickly</li></ul><p>Each of these pillars can have 10s if not 100s of blog posts to be written under them. But they also all work together to show that you’re a thought leader in your niche.</p><p><strong>4.

However, I can say from experience that those ideas aren’t always there. Sometimes running a blog is harder than it seems.

Aim for things you know your ideal audience would find valuable. What questions are they asking? Where do you have expertise and can help fill in the blanks?</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Use a keyword research tool to gather even more ideas:</strong> We want a TON of these blog post topics, so let’s use a keyword explorer tool like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Ahrefs</a> (pictured above), <a href="https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Google Keyword Planner</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://moz.com/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Moz</a> to help us fill it out. These tools basically just show you terms and topics related to the ones you’ve already come up with, as well as how much traffic those terms are getting (to show that your audience cares about them!)</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Clump similar ideas together:</strong> Your list should be pretty huge at this point. So take all those terms and start to refine them. Are there duplicates that you can lump together? Do some just not look right now? Refine and edit it down.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Put your ideas in a spreadsheet and prioritize:</strong> Ok, let’s get this list a little more organized now. Start a spreadsheet and include your keyword, estimated search volume, difficulty, and opportunity (You should be able to get all this info from the keyword tool you use). Looking at all these, assign a priority to each one either on a scale of 1-5 or a basic High-Medium-Low. Join my <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/start-blog-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">free blogging course</a> to grab my editorial calendar template.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Outline content that hits all three key needs:</strong> Take your top priorities and set deadlines for them. Look for topics that hit all three key needs: Fits your content pillars, are genuine needs of your readers, and have some potential to <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/drive-traffic-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">drive traffic to your website</a> in the long run.</li></ul><p>If I'm still left needing more blog post ideas, I'll turn to even more creative tactics...</p><ul><li>Asking my existing readers what challenges they're facing and what they want to hear most from me.</li><li>Taking a look through my most successful posts to see which topics and tones of voice my readers liked most.</li><li>Doing more quote roundup series-style posts (like my post about <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/start-business-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">business advice</a> and <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/side-business-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">online business tools</a>) that don't require a ton of original thought and effort from my end.</li><li>Chatting with fellow bloggers in my space and brainstorming fresh ideas with them.</li><li>Talking about specific lessons I've recently learned or experiments I've launched on my blog.</li><li>Reflecting on both the mistakes I've recently made and the tactics that are working today (and why).</li></ul><p>By this point, I've usually got a fully restocked content calendar.</p><p>But what's important to keep top of mind when deciding how to prioritize which posts you should write first vs last, is how much potential traffic you could stand to drive from eventually ranking well in organic search for that topic.</p><p>This goes back to consistently doing keyword research before ever starting to write a new article. Not only does it ensure you'll have the opportunity to eventually monetize your traffic, but it validates that other people out there in the world actually want to consume content on the subject at hand.</p><p><strong>5. Map out the content you’re going to create before launching your blog.</strong></p><p>Before you launch your blog, you <em>might</em> want to have a bit of content already ready to go. This is optional, and I personally do this both ways with new blogs I launch, depending on many variables.</p><p>But if you have a decent sized audience on a social network that you plan on alerting once your block launches, you never know if your first post might blow up and go viral. In that case, you'll want to have&nbsp;at least a game plan to engage the new readers you get.</p><p>As Grace Moser of <em>Chasing Foxes </em><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/side-hustle-blog-chasing-foxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">told me</a>&nbsp;on the podcast recently:</p><p><em>“I think it’s important to create a number of blog posts before you launch. We did 40 and put them all up on our site when we first launched. If you want to get lots of viewers right up front you need to create that content beforehand. People want instant gratification.”</em></p><p><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/side-hustle-blog-chasing-foxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="lazy-hidden  wp-image-2627 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser.jpg" alt="How to Start a Blog with Grace and Silas Moser of Chasing Foxes" width="746" height="373" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser.jpg 900w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser-300x150.jpg 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser-768x384.jpg 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser-630x315.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px"><noscript><img class=" wp-image-2627 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser.jpg" alt="How to Start a Blog with Grace and Silas Moser of Chasing Foxes" width="746" height="373" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser.jpg 900w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser-300x150.jpg 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser-768x384.jpg 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TSHP_Grace-and-Silas-Moser-630x315.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></noscript></a></p><p>Now, you don’t have to go all-out like Grace did and write 40 pieces of content before you go live. It helped that she was working full-time on preparing to start a blog for several weeks leading up to their big launch day.</p><p>Even just a post or two under each of your major content pillars is definitely enough, but if writing comes easily to you, it's ok to do a little more.

Here are a few of my favorites:</p><ul><li><a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Trello</a>&nbsp;(free)</li><li><a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Google Docs</a>&nbsp;(free) &amp; <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Google Calendar</a>&nbsp;(free)</li><li><a href="https://coschedule.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">CoSchedule</a>&nbsp;(paid)</li><li><a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Airtable</a> (free limited with paid upgrades)</li></ul><p>Personally, I prefer using a combination of Trello and Google Docs to manage my content pipeline.

As Grace Moser of <em>Chasing Foxes</em> shared with me during her interview, they grew their blog to millions of monthly readers by putting out 4–6 pieces of content a week for several months in a row before getting real traction:</p><p><em>“Even if the majority of your posts don’t go viral, the more you publish, the better the odds that one will send a lot of traffic your way.”</em></p><div class="tm-tweet-clear"></div><div class="tm-click-to-tweet"><div class="tm-ctt-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22The+more+you+publish+on+your+blog%2C+the+better+the+odds+of+one+going+viral.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">"The more you publish on your blog, the better the odds of one going viral."</a></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%22The+more+you+publish+on+your+blog%2C+the+better+the+odds+of+one+going+viral.%22&amp;via=theryanrobinson&amp;related=theryanrobinson&amp;url=https://www.ryrob.com/how-start-blog/" target="_blank" class="tm-ctt-btn" data-wpel-link="internal">Click To Tweet</a></p><div class="tm-ctt-tip"></div></div><p>Now, there’s a fine line to walk when you first start a blog and want to set a rigorous publishing schedule.</p><p>You might have a ton of ideas and enthusiasm, but over-committing is the easiest way to kill both of those. Instead, you should commit to the minimum amount you want to publish—say once or twice a week—and try to stick to that religiously.</p><p>As author and blogger James Clear said in an interview on my podcast, “Sacrifice the scope, not the schedule.” If you can’t write a 1000-word post every week then write a 500-word post instead.

Make it readable</strong></p><p>Design isn’t about crazy colors, multiple fonts, and tons of images and videos. It’s about making the experience of your reader as enjoyable as possible. That’s why the first thing you should think about when it comes to transitioning from the basics of learning how to start a blog over to perfecting your design, isn’t what you can add. But what you can take away.</p><p>White space or negative space is so important to the legibility and readability of your blog. So don’t start by cramming a bunch of design elements everywhere. Look for ways to make things flow easily (a good theme should do this for you).</p><p>Next, make sure your font size is big enough. 12pt is fine in a Word doc, but for your blog you’ll want to go 16pt or higher. You’ll also want to be careful with line length. Most designers say the ideal length of a sentence on your blog is 50–85 characters as it helps keep readers moving through the post.</p><p>I’m on the higher end of the spectrum, but feel it works because I write in-depth, long-form content:</p><p><img class="lazy-hidden  wp-image-3924 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image.png" alt="" width="747" height="187" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image.png 771w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image-300x75.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image-768x192.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px"><noscript><img class=" wp-image-3924 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image.png" alt="" width="747" height="187" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image.png 771w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image-300x75.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-ot-Start-a-Blog-on-the-Side-Steps-to-Success-Image-768x192.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></noscript></p><p>If all this sounds complicated, don’t worry. We have a very emotional response to good design. Try some fonts and spacing options out and see what feels good to you.</p><p><strong>2. Always include a relevant image at the top of your blog post</strong></p><p>The human brain has two ways it remembers things: verbally and visually.</p><p>If you can combine the two at the top of your post, you have a better shot at people remembering you and becoming a fan of your blog. What I mean is that you should always have an image at the top of your post that relates to it.</p><p>Here’s one from my post about the <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/side-business-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">101 Best Online Business Tool</a>s:</p><p><img class="lazy-hidden wp-image-3926 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post.png" alt="How to Start a Blog Example of Best Online Business Tools Post" width="743" height="656" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post.png 1534w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post-300x265.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post-768x678.png 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post-1024x904.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px"><noscript><img class="wp-image-3926 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post.png" alt="How to Start a Blog Example of Best Online Business Tools Post" width="743" height="656" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post.png 1534w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post-300x265.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post-768x678.png 768w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Best-Online-Business-Tools-Post-1024x904.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></noscript></p><p>By including a relevant image at the top of the post (and superimposing the title on it), I’m making a stronger connection with my reader. Now, you don’t need to put text over your image. Anything that’s relevant and works with the theme of the post is good.</p><p><strong>3. Use lots of sub headers to break up copy</strong></p><p>Readers get tired quickly. And looking at a giant wall of text is intimidating and can make people leave your blog. That’s why I suggest including a heading or sub-header every 300-500 words. Some people say it should be even less than that, but I think it depends on your niche and how long your posts are. As always, do what feels natural to you.</p><p>I also try to include images around each heading in my post to break up the flow of text.

Use styling to emphasize key parts of your post</strong></p><p>Good blog design guides your reader through the post. And one of the easiest ways to do that is to emphasize key parts with bold or italics. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:</p><p><img class="lazy-hidden wp-image-3928 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Stylized-Text.png" alt="How to Start a Blog Example of Stylized Text" width="743" height="73" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Stylized-Text.png 753w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Stylized-Text-300x29.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px"><noscript><img class="wp-image-3928 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Stylized-Text.png" alt="How to Start a Blog Example of Stylized Text" width="743" height="73" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Stylized-Text.png 753w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-Example-of-Stylized-Text-300x29.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></noscript></p><p>Notice how I used bold text to highlight the key phrase I want you to pick up on? And italics to indicate just how much value you can expect to get from this post?</p><p>It’s a great tactic, but also one that can be overdone quickly. You can’t say everything in your post is important. So use it sparingly.</p><p><strong>5. Make sure people know where they are</strong></p><p>I get a lot of my blog traffic from organic search. Which means people might not necessarily know who I am when they get to the page. To build a lasting connection with them and make them feel comfortable, I make sure to have a short blurb about who I am at the top of the page.

Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat. Whatever platform best suits your niche and your audience is the right one for you.

Same thing goes for the husband and wife team behind <em>Chasing Foxes</em> who have used <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/side-hustle-blog-chasing-foxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">their own techniques on Pinterest</a> to drive millions of readers a month:</p><p><em>“I learned that Buzzfeed will put out multiple images for a post and so I decided to do the same thing. I’ll create 5 or 6 Pinterest pins per post with sometimes different titles or images. Once we started doing that, that’s when I started to see a lot of traffic come through.” </em></p><p>The key thing here is to experiment and see what works for you.</p><p>Each social network naturally appeals to a certain niche and a certain type of reader. This is a pretty broad statement, but generally speaking, here’s what works best on each social platform:</p><ul><li><strong>Facebook: </strong>Videos and curated content</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> High-res photos, quotes, and Stories</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> News, blog posts, and GIFs</li></ul><ul><li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Professional content and career news</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> Infographics, step-by-step photo guides, visual content</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Google+:</strong> Blog posts you want to rank well on Google</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Reddit:</strong> Comments about topics in your niche</li></ul><p>It’s a lot. But luckily there are lots of tools that can help you manage your social media posts throughout the week. In fact, with the right tool, you should be able to promote all your posts across social in just an hour or two a week. Here are my favorites:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Buffer</a>: </strong>One of the easiest ways to schedule social shares in advance for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google Plus. Their browser plug-in is also great for quickly adding interesting posts you find to your social promotion queue.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Hootsuite</strong></a>: If you want something a bit more in-depth, Hootsuite is a powerful social sharing, scheduling, and monitoring platform. It’s probably a bit too much for a beginner blogger, but is a worthwhile option to check out once you start to grow.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://gainapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Gain App</strong></a>: If you work with multiple people on your blog, Gain is a great tool for collaborating and controlling who posts what from your account. It’s a bit more expensive, but their workflows can save you a ton of time.</li></ul><h3><strong>Forums and message boards</strong></h3><p>Sometimes just throwing your ideas out into the social media void isn’t worth it.

And eventually, as her network grew, she was able to make better connections and start posting on bigger blogs.</p><p>For my own blog, one of my biggest early breaks came from <a href="https://open.buffer.com/meaningful-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">my very first guest post</a>&nbsp;going up on the blog for social media scheduling app Buffer. Not only did I tap into their audience of 1 million+ readers per month, but it also associated me with a brand that people in my niche look up to.</p><p>However, getting a guest post on a blog like Buffer’s isn’t easy and I was only able to make that happen because I cultivated a relationship with their blog editor over the course of weeks—by first featuring Buffer as a resource both on my blog and prominently in the content I wrote for my day job at the CreativeLive blog.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t look for other places with established audiences you can write for... in fact, that's one of your quickest paths to building up a regular readership and getting your blog to credibility faster.</p><p>For starters... try reposting your blog posts on <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Medium</strong></a>—a site that’s free to use for readers and writers. You can even look for a Medium Publication that’s popular in your niche and submit your post to them.</p><p>There’s also <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Quora</strong></a>—a question and answer site that lets anyone respond to user’s queries. One tactic I’ve used is to search for relevant topics in my niche and then answer questions I’ve already written about on my blog (like this Quora answer about <a href="https://www.quora.com/Ive-started-a-blog-How-can-I-increase-blog-traffic/answer/Ryan-Robinson-2?share=01f6bced&amp;srid=h4QP" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">how to get blog traffic</a> that's received hundreds of upvotes and thousands of views_ . This way I know I’m giving them good value and can even link back to the full post on my blog.</p><p>Lastly, if you’re more business-oriented in your blog posts, you might want to post them on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>.</p><p>The key point to all of this is that you want to look for places where your audience is and be there.

Simply put a signup in your posts and on your site. Or, do what <em>Learn to Code with me</em> <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/become-freelance-developer-coding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">founder Laurence Bradford did</a> and offer special content for people in return for their email address:</p><p><em>“If you have a blog post on your site and you have some sort of checklist or book they can get just by giving their email that can work really well. I still get around 50 new email subscribers a day just from old posts that have these content upgrades.” </em></p><p>Personally, I use a tool I love called <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/convertkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ConvertKit</a> to manage the 53,000+ email subscribers to my blog.</p><p>I send my community an update whenever I post a new blog post, have a resource I want to share, or when new podcast episodes go live—and this now ensures my content will quickly be seen by thousands of people right off the bat.</p><p>This has by far been the biggest driver of growth and revenue for my blog, and something I can’t suggest enough.</p><h3><strong>Other ways to grow your blog’s traffic</strong></h3><p>Outside of promotion on social and email and guest posts, there are a few other techniques I’ve personally used to grow my blog audience quickly:</p><ul><li><strong>Interview people in your niche: </strong>There’s nothing better than learning from famous people in your niche. Not only does interviewing them help you build a relationship, but other people reading your blog want to hear from them. You can use these interviews for blog posts or even start a podcast like I did with <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">The Side Hustle Project</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Network with other bloggers or mention their blogs:</strong> Early on, you want to get on other people’s radars. And one of the best ways to do that is to mention other relevant bloggers and blog posts on yours. For Austin Belack, founder of <a href="https://cultivatedculture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><em>Cultivated Culture</em></a>, that meant linking out to relevant blog posts and then emailing the blogger and saying “Hey! I mentioned you in my most recent article. If you think it’s worthy of a share, I’d really appreciate it. But if not, I’m happy to keep sharing yours.” This drove the initial 50,000 to 60,000 readers to his blog.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Talk to people about what you’re doing:</strong> It might seem too simple, but tell the people around you what you’re doing. Get excited about your blog and share the things you’re working on. As Gaby Dalkin of <em>What’s Gaby Cooking</em> told me: “Maybe it’s just your friends reading you to start, but you should be responding to every comment and going out and commenting on other blogs. This is essentially your industry and these are your coworkers.”</li><li><strong>Learn from other top bloggers:</strong> If you don’t feel ready to connect with other bloggers in your space, at least try to learn from what they’re doing. For Silas Moser, one half of <em>Chasing Foxes</em> told me, you should study people who are good at what you’re doing: “Look at what works for them and see how you can use it. So many people told us ‘you could never make money from a blog.’ But you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

That means you'll likely need some semblance of a readership base before you're able to broker a sponsored content deal—because the sponsor's going to want to see your readers click through and at least evaluate the special offer you're writing about.</p><p>The best way to do sponsored content without alienating your readers, is to weave it into your typical publishing style (like I've done with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">this sponsored post</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/how-to-pitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">this one too</a>), of which I charged $1,500 to write and publish for Skillshare and Slidebean.</p><p>Unless you already have a sizable option on another site (or social account) that you plan to use for driving traffic to your blog, it'll take you some time to grow your readership to a point where sponsored content is a viable monetization option.</p><p>Here's a snapshot of my first year of traffic to ryrob.com (in orange) and my second year of traffic (in blue).</p><p><img class="lazy-hidden wp-image-4326 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-1024x504.png" alt="How to Start a Blog ryrob year 1 vs year 2 blogging" width="762" height="375" srcset="" data-srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-1024x504.png 1024w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-300x148.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-768x378.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"><noscript><img class="wp-image-4326 aligncenter" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-1024x504.png" alt="How to Start a Blog ryrob year 1 vs year 2 blogging" width="762" height="375" srcset="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-1024x504.png 1024w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-300x148.png 300w, https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/How-to-Start-a-Blog-ryrob-year-1-vs-year-2-blogging-768x378.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></noscript></p><p>As you'll see, my first year of blogging saw only about 9,000 total readers, but I wasn't really taking blogging seriously and I was still learning how to drive traffic.

You'll want to build out your key pages (About, Contact, Hire Me) and showcase at least a couple examples of the type of work you've done that you'll soon be pitching freelance clients on.</p><p>And if you don't have those work samples yet... don't let that hold you back. Spend a few days right now to create those example articles, designs or other deliverables and host them on your own blog as if they were a project you got paid to produce.</p><p>If you have a skill that you can sell as a service, then you're already prepared to go out and start pitching potential clients.

But that's where I am today... not where I started.</p><p>My first freelance client paid me $250 for each article I wrote for their blog. They discovered me because of my blog, and liked the style of content I was producing, so it was an easy decision for them to hire me as a freelancer to ramp up their publishing at an affordable rate.</p><p>After having this realization, I started going out and pitching other similar (non-competitive) startups and online brands that clearly needed more business-related content for their blogs... and over the course of the next year, I continued to slowly double the prices I'd charge per article. I'd add new "extras" as time went on and I built a larger community &amp; brand for myself too—always experimenting with my offer to see what clients would pay more for.</p><p>If freelancing sounds like your cup of tea, you'll want to grab my (free) collection of all my best resources, tools and templates for freelancers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/freelance-resource-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">right here</a>.

That also helped me sell an early sponsorship slot for 10 episodes to <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/freshbooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Freshbooks</a> at $500/episode to help fund getting the show off the ground.</p><p>That worked for me because of where my blog was already at—but when you're starting out with less traction, I recommend getting a few episodes recorded and launching your show without trying to book a sponsorship in advance.</p><p>Release a handful of episodes and ask any guests you've interviewed or mentioned to share with their communities. Those that tune in and like your show will subscribe and stick around. One of the best ways to reach more listeners and grow your download numbers is to be a guest on other (more established) podcasts in your space.</p><p>For much more on the mechanics behind launching a podcast with your blog, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/start-podcast-michael-sacca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">this episode on my show with Michael Sacca of Rocketship.fm</a>, whose grown his show into a $10,000/mo source of side income while he still holds onto his day job in sales and marketing.

Think global companies like Amazon, all the way down to key players in specific niches like online education where brands like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/creativelive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">CreativeLive</a>, <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/skillshare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Skillshare</a> and <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/udemy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Udemy</a> have lucrative programs.

A few months ago, he launched a new paid weekly email newsletter for freelancers that surfaces the best gigs of the week for them, called&nbsp;<a href="https://members.solidgigs.com/?utm_source=ryrob&amp;utm_medium=blog" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener">SolidGigs</a>.</p><p>Since I have a large proportion of freelancers in my audience, he offered to set me up as an affiliate where I'd earn a set fee for each new paid subscriber that signed up as a result of an email or clickthrough from my blog. The week I sent my first email out to my community about SolidGigs, nearly 100 people signed up to try it out. And that number's only continued to grow over the months, adding more to my recurring income that comes from this channel.</p><p>The takeaway here is that you don't need to be confined to&nbsp;<em data-redactor-tag="em">just</em>&nbsp;the affiliate opportunities you find on the major networks like ShareASale, Rakuten, Flex Offers, Commission Junction and others.</p><p>Once you've built even a small readership... if they're engaged and tuned in to what you have to say, that's ammo to go out and broker an affiliate deal with individual business owners, startups and brands that want to surface their products to your kind of audience.</p><p>For a LOT more on the subject of monetizing your blog with affiliate income, listen to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/making-sense-of-cents-michelle-schroeder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">my interview with Michelle Schroeder who earns $130,000/mo from her blog</a>&nbsp;(mostly via affiliate programs).</p><h3><strong>7. Physical Products and Software Tools.</strong></h3><p>Similar in concept to launching an online course to your blog audience, another great way to monetize your audience is by selling (by first pre-launching) a physical product or software tool to the people in your community.</p><p>At the end of the day, this one all comes back down to solving the problems your blog readers have.</p><p>If you can build a relationship with 10 early readers and work with them to pinpoint a challenge you're interested in building a physical or digital product for, focus next on&nbsp;<em data-redactor-tag="em">repeatedly solving that problem yourself</em>, then develop a plan of action for how you can personally help those 10 people solve that problem in their own unique situations as well. This'll be very manually at first, but that's necessary.</p><p>Next, ask these 10 readers to "pre-order" the product from you and work with them through a personal coaching regimen that you'll use to make sure your eventual product has all the necessary features in order to successfully solve their challenge.</p><p>At the end of this validation process, you'll emerge with a solution that's built on the foundation of genuinely helping your readers.</p><p>Tune in to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ryrob.com/hiten-shah-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">my interview with Hiten Shah</a>, who's used his personal blog to connect with his target audience and release several profitable software tools as a result of the validation conversations he's had with them.</p><h3><strong>8. Business Partnerships.</strong></h3><p>Of all the ways to monetize your blog, this is the most unpredictable. Who knows who you'll meet as a result of building your blog? What about future guests on your podcast? The possibilities here for stumbling into partnership opportunities are endless.</p><p>As a result of sticking with my blog for several years, I've been able to use it as a tool to meet some incredibly talented entrepreneurs.</p><p>I've collaborated with my friend Jory (a writer and content marketer) that I met originally because of my blog, on growing a $10,000/mo content marketing agency together that we both still run as a side project to all of our other work.</p><p>I've launched new websites with other established bloggers who have similar audiences as my own.</p><p>There's even a former podcast guest who's helping me build a software tool I've envisioned for years.</p><p>It's true that there aren't as many ways to authentically engineer the creation of these types of partnerships, aside from growing your personal brand and the reach of your blog... and then being receptive to the creative people &amp; ideas that come your way as others discover your blog.</p><p>On the flip side, if there's someone in your space that you really want to collaborate and work with, strategize on a way you can add value to their business first. Build a community of people you know they'll want to reach too—and then start building a relationship with your influencer before pitching them on a collaboration idea.</p><h2><strong>Over to You...</strong></h2><p>What this all boils down to is being excited and engaging with your content.</p><p>If you want people to read what you’re writing, you need to give them a reason to.</p><p>Write exciting content, connect with people in the space, and enthusiastically share what you’re working on.</p><p><strong>The monetization and everything else will follow.</strong></p><p>Wow.</p><p>We got through a lot here.</p><p>I wrote this guide to learning how to start a blog because launching a blog has been one of the most empowering, life-changing decisions I've made in my life.</p><p>And I hope that by now you feel confident enough to go out there are start a blog of your own.</p><p>I'd love to have you in my free 7-day course that'll teach you my proven <strong><a href="https://www.ryrob.com/start-blogging-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">step-by-step process to launching a blog in just 1 week</a></strong>&nbsp;and in the course, we also dive deep even further into topics like driving traffic, my personal writing process, monetizing your blog and more.</p><p>You can sign up (for free) and join thousands of bloggers I've helped to get their sites off the ground and earning right here...</p><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Want my Free Course: How to Start a Profitable Blog in 7 Days?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: center;">Enter your name and email address and you'll get instant&nbsp;access to my course that's been featured on <em>Forbes</em>, <em>Business Insider</em> and <em>Entrepreneur</em>.</p><div id="5ca649bc29916" class="optin-box optin-box-6" style="margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;"><div class="optin-box-content"><form action="https://www.ryrob.com/process-optin-form/" method="post" class="cf op-optin-validation"><div style="display:none"><input type="hidden" name="provider" value="convertkit"><input type="hidden" name="redirect_url" value="https://www.ryrob.com/check-your-email-course/"><input type="hidden" name="list" value="400978"></div><div class="text-boxes"><div class="text-box name"><input type="text" required="required" name="name" placeholder="Enter your first name" value=""></div><div class="text-box email"><input type="email" required="required" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" value=""></div></div><div style="text-align:center"><button type="submit" id="btn_1_57921bcf97731e16ffbaaef5cb376078" class="css-button style-1 location_optin_box_style_7"><span class="text">Join Now</span><span class="hover"></span><span class="active"></span></button></div> <input type="hidden" name="op_gdpr_consent_notes_field" value="missing_integration_type"> <input type="hidden" name="op_gdpr_button_label" value="Join Now"> <input type="hidden" value="493200" name="op_gdpr_consent_tag[]"> <input type="hidden" id="op_optin_nonce" name="op_optin_nonce" value="90a223cfb0"><input type="hidden" name="_wp_http_referer" value="/how-start-blog/"></form><p class="privacy"><img class="lazy-hidden" src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-lazy-type="image" data-src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/optin_box/privacy.png" alt="privacy" width="16" height="15"><noscript><img src="https://mk0ryrobg0ysk5t06n.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/plugins/optimizePressPlugin/lib/assets/images/optin_box/privacy.png" alt="privacy" width="16" height="15" /></noscript> Trust me, I hate spam just as much as you do.</p></div></div><div class="styled-hr hr-style-10"><div class="hr-1"></div><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><p>To sum things up.

Here are my answers to the most common beginner blogging questions people also ask when learning how to start a blog.</p><h3><strong>How do you start a blog for free?</strong></h3><p>If you want to start a blog for free, you’re in luck! There are tons of ways you can get started blogging today <em>(in half an hour or less)</em> that are absolutely free. Free blogging platforms like Medium, Tumblr and Blogger are great places to start a blog for free and begin practicing at building your writing skills—especially if your blog is meant to be a hobby. Just head over to one of those sites, set up a free account, and you’ll be blogging in a matter of just a few minutes.</p><p>Over the long-term however, if your blogging goal is to generate an income from blogging, or eventually build a business around your blog, choosing to start a blog with one of the many affordable hosting platforms like my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>, or alternatives like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/namecheap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">NameCheap</a> or <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/hostgator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">HostGator</a> will afford you many more options for customization, your own dedicated domain name (like <em>yourblog.com</em>), and the guarantee of hands on help &amp; support with any technical challenges you face over the months and years to come with your blog.</p><h3><strong>How do you become a blogger and get paid?</strong></h3><p>Becoming a blogger, and actually getting paid for it are two very different things. While it’s a very realistic goal to start a blog and expect to begin getting paid from various different monetization methods you can implement within as little as a few months of work, the reality is that most bloggers don’t ever earn a life-changing income from their blogs.</p><p>In order to become a blogger, all you need to do is publish your first blog post—either on a free blogging platform or through your own self-hosted blog (what I recommend). Boom. That’s it. Welcome to the world of blogging.</p><p>Now when it comes to actually getting paid from your blog, there are a ton of options. From joining display ad networks, to getting sponsored posts from companies that want to reach your readers, affiliate promotions, landing freelance or consulting gigs, teaching online courses, selling physical products, building software tools and more, there are many different ways to get paid from blogging. I break down my 8 favorite ways to monetize your blog here in this guide.</p><h3><strong>How do I start a personal blog?</strong></h3><p>The first step to starting a personal blog is choosing whether you want to use a free blogging platform like Medium, Tumblr and Blogger (that all come with limitations) if you’re blogging as a hobby, or if you want to start a personal blog with the eventual goal of earning an income from your blog by using a self-hosted WordPress install and ultra affordable hosting at less than $3.00/month from a company like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>—the latter of which is how my personal blog here is operated.</p><p>Personally, I recommend going the route of a self-hosted WordPress blog, because you’ll be able to own your own domain name, control everything about the design and branding of your blog and have way more flexibility in terms of making money from your blog (which I cover at length in this guide right here).</p><h3><strong>How do you start a blog for beginners?</strong></h3><p>Starting a blog for beginners is easy, we’re breaking it down in ten simple (quick) steps here in this guide, and in less than ten minutes you should be able to get your blog started and live on the Internet, even as a total beginner. Get started at the top of the guide here.</p><h3><strong>How do beginner blogs make money?</strong></h3><p>Beginner blogs make money from a variety of sources that don’t require a large number of readers, like landing freelance or consulting clients, getting opportunities to be a paid speaker if you’re experienced in your industry, one-on-one coaching, teaching in-person or online courses, selling physical or digital products, and if you’re able to quickly generate readers for your blog—that creates more monetization opportunities through things like sponsored content, affiliate promotions, selling your advice to readers, and more.</p><h3><strong>How much time does it take to start making money from blogging?</strong></h3><p>You can make money from blogging in as little as 1 month if you’re talking about the first time you earn <em>anything</em> from your blog. However, if you’re talking about getting to a more significant level of income (or repeatable streams of income), 3 to 6 months is a much more realistic time frame if you’re able to allocate a sizable amount of time to growing your blog.</p><p>There’s certainly a long-tail effect though, where the longer you stick with blogging (1, 2, 3+ years), the more content you’ll have published on your blog, the more authority your site will have, the more readers who will be coming by and thus the more you should earn. For context, five years into blogging, I'm now earning over $50,000/mo from my blog.</p><p>Moreover, the time to making money from your blog varies a lot based on many different factors like the topics you’re writing about, whether you have an existing audience somewhere (or are starting from scratch), how much time you’re able to allocate to writing and promoting your blog content, if you have any relationships with more established bloggers, brands or websites that can help accelerate your progress by letting you guest post, which ways you choose to start monetizing your blog (see my section about monetization above) because some are much easier/quicker than others, how well you’re able to implement your monetization strategy, and many other variables.</p><h3><strong>Is WordPress free?</strong></h3><p>Yes! To be clear, there are two different versions of WordPress out there. What most bloggers use, the WordPress.org version, serves as a 100% free CMS (content management system) that powers the majority of websites on the internet. It’s what I use as the backend CMS to power my blog here, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly because of how widely customizable it is—and the fact that it’s completely free.</p><p>Now, the other version of WordPress, is what you’ll find at WordPress.com. While this service is owned and operated by the same parent company that maintains the <em>free</em> version of WordPress, the .com version is how the parent company generates revenue with their blog hosting plans (this is how they can afford to keep the .org version of WordPress free for all of us bloggers out there). From WordPress.com, you can actually start a blog for free too—but as we covered earlier in this guide, it’ll come pre-loaded with WordPress branding built-in and your blog will live on a subdomain like <em>yourblog.wordpress.com</em> instead of your own custom domain like <em>yourblog.com</em>.</p><h3><strong>How do I create a personal blog for free?</strong></h3><p>You can create a personal blog for free on several different platforms, including Medium, Tumblr and Blogger, which are all great places to practice writing if your blog is designed to be a hobby or just for fun.</p><p>Now, if on the other hand you’re looking to make money from your blog, you’ll want to go with a self-hosted WordPress powered blog, with extremely affordable hosting (as little as $3.00/mo) from a company like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a>. Why? While you can definitely create a personal blog for free with one of the sites I mentioned above, you’ll be very limited in your options. You’ll be stuck with prominent branding from the free blogging platform you choose, you’ll miss out on the opportunity to own your own domain name (like <em>yourblog.com</em>), and many of the more passive monetization channels for making money from your blog are likely to be somewhat restricted on free platforms.</p><p>When you start a blog using the steps I’ve outlined in this guide, you’ll own your website—and have unlimited control over every decision you make with it. So if your goal is to build a business and make money blogging, your only smart option is to choose a self-hosted WordPress powered blog (like mine here) and affordable hosting from a dependable company like <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="nofollow">Bluehost</a>.</p><h3><strong>How do you start a free blog and make money?</strong></h3><p>The best way to start a free blog and make money, is to choose a simple free blogging platform like Medium, Tumblr or Blogger, and create a quick profile for yourself. You can relatively quickly make money from your free blog by building a reputation for yourself as an expert within your industry. Commit to writing regularly, engaging with others in your niche, networking to build relationships, and position yourself as either a consultant for hire, paid event speaker, parlay your free blog into a book deal, or use your new reputation to become a coach, teacher or advisor to others who want to learn from you.</p><h3><strong>How much do bloggers make?</strong></h3><p>The amount of income bloggers make can vary widely. While the majority of bloggers earn very little (especially in their early days of blogging), as your website traffic grows, you’ll have many more opportunities to monetize your blog and begin earning much more from it. Today, I make <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/income/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">anywhere from $18,000 to $60,000 per month from my blog</a>—on the side of still holding a full-time job, which makes for a nice cushion of extra savings for me.</p><p>In total over the past couple years, I've made between $150,000 and $500,000 per year as a blogger (part-time). My blogging income can vary quite a bit depending upon the number of sponsorships I’m running, how well certain posts are doing as far as driving traffic and affiliate income, the number of students joining my paid online courses, how many freelance clients I accept, and several other variables.</p><p>While most bloggers won’t typically make this much money from their blogs each year, there are plenty of bloggers earning much, much more than me—some well into the several hundreds of thousands of dollars each month. Moreover, I’m living proof that it’s possible to start a blog from scratch and begin making money from it within as little as a few months. Building a profitable blog is all about creating winning habits, deliberately building your readership and finding win-win ways to monetize with them.</p><h3><strong>Do bloggers get paid?</strong></h3><p>Yes, most bloggers get paid <em>somehow</em>. Bloggers get paid through a variety of different monetization paths. Some of the best ways to get paid from blogging include affiliate promotions, display advertising, sponsored content, freelance opportunities, sales of your own physical or digital products, and many of the other ways I talk about in this guide (above) when it comes to making money blogging.</p><h3><strong>How do I determine how much demand there is for the topics I want to blog about?</strong></h3><p>Before diving into determining demand, let’s cover an important term: Estimated Monthly Search Volume (MSV). This is an estimate you can get from a free or paid keyword research tool like SEMrush, Wordstream, Ahrefs and KWFinder, that'll give you their estimate of how many searches are done on the keyword phrases you run through the tool. That's pretty straight-forward.</p><p>Determining a level of demand there is for a given set of keyword phrases, on the other hand, is much more subjective and open to interpretation—but I have a free tool I put together to help you check search demand, called <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/start-blog-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">the Niche Demand Checker you can grab in my free course right here</a>.</p><p>If you ask 100 different experienced bloggers, you'll get 100 different answers. Here are the ranges that I personally use to determine the level of demand a keyword phrase has when I run it through a keyword research tool:</p><ul><li>Very Low (&lt; 1,000)</li><li>Low (1,001 - 2,000)</li><li>Medium (2,001 - 5,000)</li><li>High (5001 - 10,000)</li><li>Very High (10,000+)</li></ul><p>Keep in mind, we're talking about the number of monthly searches here, and in the context of how much search demand there is in a given <em>niche topic area</em>—which is a great place to begin when you’re learning to start a blog.</p><p>Eventually as your blog grows and you have a regular flow of new readers, you’ll be able to go after keyword phrases that get well into the tens or hundreds of thousands of monthly searches (even millions), but here we’re talking about taking on keyword phrases in a niche topic area that you’ll be able to realistically rank your content well with—that still has a decent level of search demand.</p><h3><strong>The niche I chose to blog about is crowded. How do I stand out?</strong></h3><p>By being different in some small way! There’s always an opportunity to make your blog stand out within a niche of any industry, regardless how much competition there is today. Let’s take the example of travel blogging. While there are more competitors in this space, you also typically have a much higher demand for more content than in many other industries—and proven demand is a very good thing when it comes to starting a blog.</p><p>There are literally countless trip destinations around the world, and travelers are always in need of helpful content when it comes to planning trips. Just because others cover the same destinations, doesn’t mean you can’t do it too—and still find your readers.</p><p>However, in order to truly stand out in your niche, you need to think about ways to differentiate yourself and your blog content. Examples of differentiation could be things like:</p><ul><li>High quality location-based photos</li><li>Taking the point of view of a “locals guide” to each city</li><li>Having in-depth written content that goes beyond what others write</li><li>Shooting video footage of the best sights you need to see</li><li>Documenting your journey behind the scenes on Instagram,</li></ul><p>Don’t let the fact that there are competitors stop you from choosing to start a blog on a topic you’re in love with. If anything, this is an opportunity to gather inspiration from what you see working well for competitors, adapt it to fit your own style, strengths, interests and continue building your own unique style to blogging over time.</p><h3><strong>How do I get readers to come to my blog? </strong></h3><p>I’ve written a lot about how to get readers to come to your blog in my epic guide on <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/drive-traffic-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">how to drive traffic to your website</a>. The best ways to get readers to come to your blog include first and foremost creating share-worthy content that people will actually want to read. After that, you need to nail your on-page SEO, begin guest posting on other blogs and websites that have an existing pool of readers who may be interested in what you have to say, sharing on social media, engaging in relevant online communities, being interviewed on podcasts, launching a YouTube channel, hosting webinars, speaking at conferences, getting on local television and <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/drive-traffic-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">more that I break down here</a>.</p><h3><strong>How do I log into WordPress once I’m logged out?</strong></h3><p>You can always login to your WordPress by going to <em>yourblog.com/wp-admin</em>. (Just swap out the “<em>yourblog</em>” part for your actual website’s URL of course).</p><p>If you can’t remember your login information or need to reset your password, first search your email inbox for the welcome emails you received right after originally setting up your blog. Check your spam folder just in case, too.</p><p>Those emails will have two important sets of login information: Your WordPress login, which is the “backend” CMS you’ll go to when you want to write blog posts and manage just about everything related to the look, feel and functionality of your blog. Those emails will also contain your <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/resources/bluehost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="internal">Bluehost</a> login credentials, where you’ll go to manage your hosting plan, settings, and keep your billing information up-to-date.</p><p>Now, if you’re not able to find those two emails, you’ll need to reset your password. In WordPress, you can reset your password by clicking the, “<em>Lost your password?</em>” link right below the login fields on your WordPress login page (the <em>yourblog.com/wp-admin</em> one). You can reset your Bluehost password <a href="https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/forgot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">right here</a>.</p><div class="styled-hr hr-style-0"><div class="hr-2"><hr></div></div><p>Whew!

                    <p>Hey there! Thank you so much for all this great information. My boyfriend and I are very interested in starting a blog and eventually joining affiliate programs with various vendors.  I have topics that are important to be and I have shared with close friends that have changed their lives. Some maybe profitable and others are just good mental health practices that I have learned and implemented over many years of my own struggles. My question here is: Is there a way to turn those things into a profitable blog? I would love to chat more with you either via phone or email regarding some specific ideas I have. Please email me if you have time to chat by either means.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I was just thinking about starting a blog and for that I started randomly search about blogging. Then your article popped and then I knew that blogging can be a way to earn other than being a hobby. Thank you so much. You inspired me a lot. I was a little in doubt about starting a blog but now I’m clear headed. Just wanna ask can I earn money from a free site as well? How does it work?<br>
          Thank you once again.</p>

                    <p>Great article, Ryan! </p>
          <p>First, thank you so much for sharing the importance of about page. I have been ignoring this area when it comes to setting up my website. It’s the first area I will immediately begin working for.<br>
          Moreover, WordPress has really changed the life of many young online entrepreneurs who have little or no knowledge of scripting language.</p>

                    <p>Hi Ryan,  Thank you for sharing! I am on the brink of a major life change and I am thinking of starting a blog mainly to help me process the transition and  also perhaps help another person  in the same situation.  What your wrote gave me a much needed framework to get started with.  Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Hi Ryan, I just wanted to say how impressed I am with the depth and practicality of this article. I am so grateful you are willing to share so many valuable insights to help others in the same space. Funny enough, today is the first I’ve researched starting a blog – half out of spite and half out of genuine curiosity. The spite piece comes from me constantly talking my husband’s ear off with all of my career and life observations/learnings/philosophies and getting frustrated with his lack of passion and engagement for the topics I love. The other night I joked that people are craving to hear from me and he’s squandering this personal privilege from which he’s clearly checked out. Some banter ensued and I jokingly said I will start a blog just to prove him wrong… of course, I live to prove him wrong, so I thought I’d weigh the effort/reward pay off and found your blog. </p>
          <p>What I did not expect was to find such inspiration and motivation to perhaps pursue this for real. Though I’ve had an interest in blogging as a “hobby”, I’ve been spending most of my time dreaming of starting my own side consulting gig. What I learned from your article is blogging may actually be a pathway to making that dream come true if it’s done right. I’m curious what advice you have in terms of goal setting and aligning the blog accordingly. My initial thought was to channel my passion for all things continuous improvement – both in life and career. However, if this is truly a path to consulting, I’m thinking I would have to narrow the niche significantly and focus solely on the business side of CI. Do you think there’s a practical way to cover both career/non-career focuses in a single blog, blending the content in a cohesive manner so that the everyday reader finds value in it while also attracting potential business prospects? Thanks again for your insights and awesome content!</p>

                    <p>Thank you so much, Jamie 🙂</p>
          <p>This is all SO awesome to read. The goal was definitely simplicity and depth, so I’m really glad you took something out of this guide to starting a blog. Sounds to me like you’ve got a knack for writing, I’m so excited you’ll be kicking off this journey.</p>
          <p>My consulting business was 90% (or more) of my “blogging” related income up until last year… so yes, I’d say having a blog and using it as a destination to showcase your expertise/highlight samples of your work, then it can be a very powerful selling tool. I think you can safely have career and more personal interest content living on one single blog (to stick with another theme here… don’t overthink this!). Just GET STARTED and see what begins to stick with the people that come to your blog. I’d vote for a career first and then hobbies as a close second kind of approach. You’re going to love this! </p>
          <p>Please keep me posted on how things go over the coming weeks 🙂</p>

                    <p>Hey there great blog! Does running a blog similar to this take a great deal of work?<br>
          I have very little knowledge of programming but I had been hoping to start my own blog in the near future.<br>
          Anyways, if you have any recommendations or techniques for new<br>
          blog owners please share. I know this is off<br>
          subject but I just needed to ask. Cheers!</p>

                    <p>Good question! The short answer is yes, it’s definitely taken a lot of work to GET here. On a daily basis now though, I can work a very small amount during my average work week without too much worry about income falling. </p>

                    <p>Great question! Personally, I think it should be much easier in terms of getting out more quantity of content, spending more time driving traffic, interacting with your audience, finding people to connect with and grow your presence online. Do it!</p>

                    <p>Right you are! It’s really not difficult to just get started… and that’s step #1 of the journey. You’ll learn a lot along the way just by actively publishing content, promoting your work, finding readers and going out of your way to experiment on new ways to drive traffic to your blog.</p>

                    <p>Wow! You’re definitely ahead of the curve already… I wish I had started my blog when I was 14 🙂</p>
          <p>My best advice I can give you right now is to thoroughly read through this guide (it’s packed with 24,000 words of my best tips around getting started, driving traffic and monetizing your blog), so that’d be step #1. After that,  nothing can replace the value of just diving in and beginning to learn for yourself… get your blog online, start writing &amp; publishing, begin sharing your content and finding your readers out there on social media channels, online forums/communities, other blogs and destinations where they’re already spending time. Connect with as many of them as you can, gather insights, learn from them—and make thoughtful decisions about how you can best help them using your blog &amp; other content mediums to teach.</p>
          <p>You’ll find the most success with your blog once you’ve landed on a topic you LOVE writing about (with a proven demand), and once you’ve built a close relationship with even a small number of readers. From there, you’ll learn how to find more people like them—and begin to generate revenue in win-win ways with them.</p>

                    <p>I read this article and thought hey that sounds easy, so i followed your directions and used bluehost, spent the money and thought i would be right on my way. Now that i have access and picked my domain and can actually edit the site i could not be more confused. Is there something im missing?</p>

                    <p>Hey Jesse! I’d need a little more context to help you out with the specifics of getting back to where you can edit your site (and onto making customizations), but generally speaking—if you (1) log into your Bluehost portal and then (2) log into the WordPress admin area of your website (usually located at yourblog.com/wp-admin/) you’ll then be able to edit the layout of your blog, install new WordPress themes that come with more readily customizable features and options, install plugins that help customize areas of your blog and more. I go into all that in more depth in my free blogging course here: <a href="https://ryrob.teachable.com/p/build-a-blog-in-7-days-free-course" rel="nofollow">https://ryrob.teachable.com/p/build-a-blog-in-7-days-free-course</a></p>

                    <p>My wife has been thinking about starting a blog that details her experiences living in multiple different countries. It really helped when you said to not look at what you can add to your blog, but what you can take away from it. It is very important that your readers can easily access the information that you are trying to provide for them.</p>

                    <p>Couldn’t agree more… especially in the very early days of starting your blog, the more you’ve got going on, the more distracting it’ll be to both you and your readers. Stay focused with your eyes on the prize.</p>

                    <p>Boom! This guide to starting a blog is a living example that the bar is constantly being raised when it comes to creating content that’ll attract readers—that’s been a big part of why this guide has risen so high (and very quickly) in organic search. My philosophy is to jam as much free value as possible into my content 😊</p>

                    <p>I’m so excited I found your site! I really found you by error, while I was looking on AskJeeves for something else. Regardless I am here now and would just like to say thank you for an incredible post about starting a blog and an all round entertaining blog (I also love the theme/design). When I have time I will be back to read a great deal more, so please do keep up the excellent work.</p>

                    <p>You’re welcome, Samuel! </p>
          <p>It’s hard to say how long this guide to start a blog took to write, because I’ve been slowly adding more to it every month for the past ~8 months since I published it 🙂</p>
          <p>To estimate though, somewhere around at least 60 hours. The first draft took about 25 hours in total, including formatting—and since then I’ve added a LOT of content to this (now totaling 24,000 words in length) ⚡️</p>

                    <p>Nice article,, Thanks for sharing it. The field of web development is rapidly changing. Thanks to open-source and innovation, as soon as you learn one technology, a new one comes along. Because of this, it can be challenging to stay up-to-date in the industry.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, web development blogs make it easy for anyone to stay current with the relevant topics of today. Whether it’s learning a new ux design application or finding someone to explain the latest trend, the internet is full of a wealth of information on these and many other topics. Sometimes you want to learn something, and a web dev blog is the best way to do it.</p>

Usually I scan through post like this but with you, it felt like every single word I read was important. I even had to reread so as not to forget anything useful. So yeah, thank you for it. And I love the fact that you kept on assuring us- beginners not to be scared. I have been thinking about starting a blog since forever but after, I really want to. Great post!Thanks for sharing.</p>

                    <p>Great question, Aleaji! I do have a Facebook group, but right now it only comes along with membership in my paid course, Built to Blog (<a href="https://ryrob.teachable.com/p/built-to-blog" rel="nofollow">https://ryrob.teachable.com/p/built-to-blog</a>). I’d love to do a free/open Facebook group one day soon, but right now I’m prioritizing my time with the students in my paid course.</p>

                    <p>Hi! I’m following this post to help start my blog and I am a little confused right now. Not sure if you would know where I went wrong or what to do, but I don’t think it would hurt to ask.<br>
          I just signed up for BlueHost and it took me to WordPress, but I am pretty sure it is automatically on wordpress.com not wordpress.org. You had suggested the .org so I would like to try that out but I’m not sure how to get there. I was never prompted.<br>
          Thank you!</p>

                    <p>Hey Kirsten! If you signed up through Bluehost, then it’ll by default be a WordPress.org setup that you’ll be going through—which is the right choice as it’s way more flexible/customizable for the future and you’ll own your own domain.</p>
